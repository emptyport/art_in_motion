# Art in Motion

This project is loosely based on [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

You will need the [Adafruit NeoPixel library](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/arduino-library-installation) to run this code.

The code is pretty short and fairly straightforward. I have a strand of 50 NeoPixel lights that I set up in a winding grid (hence the index mapping matrix).
